## About Me

Hi! I completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in robustness and generalization, especially in understanding how large-scale models behave under distribution shifts and in complex real-world settings.
